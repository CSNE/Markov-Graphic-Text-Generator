# Markov-Graphic-Text-Generator
A simple Markov Chain text generator with some (not so) pretty graphs.

To run the program, simply copy all the files into a directory and then run the main.py.

Any standard Python 3 installation (with tkinter) would run this program fine, although this has only been tested in Python 3.3 and 3.4.
